# machinelearning_assignment2
Linear Regression and Logistic Regression with sklearn
This assignment goes over basic linear regression as well as logistic regression. 
For the third part the Stellar Classification dataset is used to identify stars, quasars, and galaxies based on 18 features and 100,000 instances. 
The dataset is highly imbalanced and different pre-processing techniques were used to achieve the optimal performance using logistic regression model. 
The details of all the experiments are provided in pdf file and the source of the dataset is also included in the pdf file.
